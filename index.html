            Energetic, ambitious, and optimistic are the words that best
            describe my personality. I am an undergraduate student in Bandung
            Institute of Technology that is eager to learn and to seek
            adventures in life. Chaotic isn’t a challenge but a chance to grow.
            Currently interested in Software Engineering. Pitching, speaking,
            and negotiating is also skills that I am currently looking forward
            to.

              confirm that this happens when COVID, where I am still wearing
              uniform but having class from home. In my laptop, there is
              literally me trading using IPOT LOL. Even though, biggest L where

              and my friend having a class farewell party in Berastagi, Sumatera
              Utara. We sleep over with 20+ peeps? I suppose. Many fun events
              happen there, from eatings BPK, some of them literally drunk, and
              having jokes till midnight. The field trip is 3 days 2 night time,
              but feels like second. And now, only memory left. This picture is
              taken at the night of releasing lantern of our wishes to the sky
              from our villa at 3 A.M. in 2022.
